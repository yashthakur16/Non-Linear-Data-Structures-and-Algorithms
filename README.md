# Non-Linear Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to the Non-Linear Data Structures and Algorithms repository. This repository contains my documented practice and solutions for various data structure and algorithm problems from platforms like LeetCode, Coding Ninjas, and Geeks for Geeks, with a focus on non-linear data structures.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Solutions**: Includes solutions to a variety of problems from popular coding platforms.
- **Focused Study**: Emphasizes non-linear data structures such as trees, graphs, heaps, and more.
- **Diverse Techniques**: Demonstrates different algorithms and problem-solving techniques.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Git
- A C++ compiler (like GCC or Clang)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Non-Linear-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms.git
    cd Non-Linear-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
    ```

## Usage

Navigate through the directory to find solutions to specific problems. Each file is named according to the problem it solves.

### Example Files

- `Boundary Traversal.cpp`: Solution for performing boundary traversal of a binary tree.
- `Dijkstra's algorithm.cpp`: Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph.

## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open-source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

If you have a suggestion that would make this better, please fork the repository and create a pull request. You can also simply open an issue with the tag "enhancement".

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some better approach'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
